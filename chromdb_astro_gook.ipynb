May come, not from innate selfishness, but\\nfrom a hurt to the feelings early in life or by a parent. The result would be\\nthat he would build up a self-protective coating where emotions are\\nconcerned. Can be kind but finds it hard to put himself in the other fellow's\\nshoes. An ambitious and shrewd person to whom material things are very\\nimportant. Apt to withdraw from too close emotional involvements. Lack of\\nrelationships can lead to aloneness in old age. Psychic tendencies strong.\\nTest of Saturn in this sign is the need to learn the value of responsibility and\\nempathy.\\nSATURN IN LEO (Detriment)\\nHeart center needs developing. Constriction where heart is concerned,\\npsychically as well as physically. Great pride and often too strong an ego\\ndrive for power. Very strong willed. Disappointment through love and\\nchildren if Saturn is afflicted. Great mental vitality that can be overpowering\\nto the other fellow. Hasn't been a loving person in past lifetimes, and is often\\ndenied the love he seeks in this lifetime until his spiritual bookkeeping is\\nbalanced. Can be reserved and cautious. Saturn tests for true humility and\\nlovingness, in this sign.\\nSATURN IN VIRGO\\nGives orderly, critical, analytical mind. Needs to cultivate a sense of\\nhumor. Life is very serious for this individual. Good worker but apt to have\\ndifficulties in working relationships due to over-criticalness. Difficulties in\\nassimilating the experiences that life brings can give nervous complaints. Apt\\nto have an irritable disposition if Saturn is afflicted. Nagging could be a\\ndetriment that the individual should eliminate. A tendency to worry over\\ninconsequentials needs to be overcome. This position of Saturn makes a good\\nresearcher. a scientist or one who works in accounting or bookkeeping. A job\\nthat involves a great deal of detail will not bother him.

Here is “self” satisfaction. Where Venus\\nloves she is apt to do much for the loved one, but in this position she is apt to\\nlove herself through the loved one. A tendency to touchiness and is apt to be\\neasily offended due to self love. Apt to be inconsiderate of others without\\nrealizing it. This is a love springing into activity with ardor and enthusasm,\\nbut not a sustaining and nurturing kind of caring. Passion and aggressiveness\\ncan be strong, thus Venus may lose her sweetness in this sign. The lesson\\nneeded with this placement is the ability to put one-self in the other fellow's\\nshoes. In spite of an impulsive approach to love, Venus in Aries is idealistic,\\nand is always seeking outwardly that which can only be found within. There\\nis a tendency to lack stability for Venus can tire quickly and change her mind\\noften in the impulsive, restless sign of Aries.\\nVENUS IN TAURUS (Ruler)\\nVenus is the ruler of Taurus and is powerful in an earthy sense in this\\nsign. Physical and sensual responses to emotions and feelings are strongly\\naccentuated. Demonstrative and affectionate as well as passionate and\\nextremely possessive. Material possessions are important because Taurus is\\nthe sign that brings everything into focus on the material plane. Emotions\\ncolor the life. Fond of comfort. Can have a pleasing voice. Strong\\ndomesticity. Good disposition if not heavily afflicted. Very stubborn in a\\nquiet and unassuming way.
